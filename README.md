# BlueQTest
Build the UI based on the mock up provided. 
Run index.html for the main site. The dataGenerator.html file is just something that I put together quickly to generate a mock dataset to feed the UI.

Note:
The main site uses AJAX to retrieve the JSON file. Chrome aren't too happy about allowing cross origin file when run locally. It works fine on any localhost or Firefox.
